## Summary

This project implements a doorbell system using two ESP8266 microcontrollers communicating via the ESP-NOW protocol. One ESP8266 acts as a sender, powered by a battery and triggered by a button press. The other ESP8266 acts as a receiver, plugged into a power source and connected to a buzzer. When the sender's button is pressed, it transmits a signal to the receiver, which then activates the buzzer for a short duration (10 seconds), simulating a doorbell ring.

## Deployment

Use `build.py` to **automate the process of preparing, compiling, and deploying your MicroPython code** to an ESP board.

This interactive script streamlines the workflow by guiding you through the following steps:

1.  **Project Selection:** It first prompts you to choose whether you want to build the `sender` or the `receiver` code.
2.  **Code Compilation:** It asks if you want to compile your `.py` files into `.mpy` bytecode using `mpy-cross`. This makes the code run faster and use less memory on the device.
3.  **Device Upload:** Finally, it asks if you want to upload the prepared files directly to the root directory of your connected ESP board using `mpremote`.
