## Summary

This project implements a doorbell system using both ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers that communicate via the ESP-NOW protocol. The ESP8266 acts as the sender, powered by a battery and triggered by a button press. The ESP32 acts as the receiver and proxy, connected to a power source and a WiFi network. When the senderâ€™s button is pressed, it transmits an ESP-NOW packet to the receiver, which then sends a POST request to a Home Assistant webhook. This setup simulates a doorbell ring, allowing Home Assistant to trigger any automation you configure.

## Deployment

The ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers were programmed using MicroPython and deployed via the `mpremote` tool. To transfer the main script to the device, the following command was used, specifying the appropriate serial port for each board:

```bash
mpremote connect /dev/cu.usbserial-100 fs cp main.py :
```

Change the port to your specific device. See the list of connected devices with:

```bash
mpremote connect list
```
